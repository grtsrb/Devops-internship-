# Containerization + Docker

- Create a Dockerfile and a docker-compose for the [Intern assignment](../Intern-Assignment-Code)
    
    - Inside the docker-compose create two containers, one for the database and the other one for the application

    - Mount the secrets needed for both of the containers via docker-compose

    - Ensure that the database container always starts up before the application container
